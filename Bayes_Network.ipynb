    "\n",
    "James Bond, Q (Quartermaster), and M (Head of MI6) are in charge of the security system at MI6, the Military Intelligence Unit of the British Secret Service. MI6 runs a special program called “Double-0”, where secret spy agents are trained and deployed to gather information concerning national security. A terrorist organization named “Spectre” is planning an espionage mission and its aim is to gain access to the secret “Double-0” files stored in the MI6 database. Q has designed a special security system to protect the secret “Double-0” files. In order to gain access to these files, Spectre needs to steal from MI6 a cipher and the key to crack this cipher. Q stores this cipher in his personal database, which is guarded by heavy security protocols. The key to cracking the cipher is known only to M, who is protected by Bond."
